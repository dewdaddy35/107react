      <h3>Jackson Wear</h3>
      <p>
        Jackson Wear was started in 2019 with the birth of my son. He inspired
        me to want to make him famous with making an income for his future. We
        donated 10% of our proceed to the homeless in America. We believe the
        more people we help the more people can wear Jackson Wear.
